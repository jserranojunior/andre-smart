Title: Code 128 B barcodes
Description: Write "Code 128 B" barcodes to a web page with just a little bit of VBScript and a little HTML. Some people are charging so much for such a little thing. I wrote this so I wouldn't have to pay hundreds of dollars for it...and it was worth it. It was just a piece of cake... There are many other barcode standards out there, of course, but I leave those to someone else.
